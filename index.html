      <h1>Microsoft</h1>
      <p>
        Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and
        technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. It is also
        incorporated in Washington.[2] Microsoft's best-known software products
        are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of
        productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship
        hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft
        Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No.
        14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States
        corporations by total revenue;[3] and it was the world's largest
        software maker by revenue in 2022 according to Forbes Global 2000. It is
        considered one of the Big Five American information technology
        companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple,
        and Meta (parent company of Facebook). Microsoft was founded by Bill
        Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC
        interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal
        computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed
        by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and
        subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an
        estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the
        1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market
        and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the
        acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[4]
        followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December
        2016,[5] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in
        May 2011.[6] As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC
        compatible operating system market and the office software suite market,
        although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market
        to Android.[7] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer
        and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and
        servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services
        market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure),
        and software development (Visual Studio). Steve Ballmer replaced Gates
        as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a "devices and services"
        strategy.[8] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in
        2008,[9] entering the personal computer production market for the first
        time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of
        tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the
        acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya
        Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on
        hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the
        company's shares reach their highest value since December 1999.[10][11]
        Under Nadella's direction, the company has also heavily expanded its
        gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft
        Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition to its
        three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the third-largest
        gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2023.[12] Earlier dethroned
        by Apple in 2010, and in 2018, Microsoft reclaimed its position as the
        most valuable publicly traded company in the world.[13] In April 2019,
        Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S.
        public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon,
        respectively. As of 2023, Microsoft has the third-highest global brand
        valuation.
